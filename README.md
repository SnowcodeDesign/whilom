## What is this?

<dl>
<dd>
an adorable status bar app that runs a small script to keep your mac awake even when the lid is closed. no external monitor required. enjoy! ‚ú®
</dd>
</dl>

## What does it mean?

<dl>
<dd>
whi‚Ä¢lom, meaning "at times," having once been. üí≠
</dd>
</dl>

## How do I use this?

<dl>
<dd>
download the <code>whilom.app</code> from either the <a href="https://github.com/SnowcodeDesign/whilom/releases">releases</a> section, or the root directory of the repo. double click to open, then click on the brand new icon in your status bar to activate. it's a good idea to drag <code>whilom.app</code> into your Applications directory.
</dd>
</dl>

## Why would I use this?

<dl>
<dd>
mostly for running servers. perhaps Plex, Minecraft, or Jenkins. it's a really easy tool to understand written in 100% swift. maybe you'll find a way to make it even more useful for yourself. maybe you've been interested in status bar apps and small frame-by-frame animations. do reach out if that's the case! üíò
</dd>
</dl>

## Will it be updated?

<dl>
<dd>
yes! whilom is meant to be a living, breathing thing. suggest ideas and let's get cooking on the next big version. but let's not weigh it down too much, no? üóû
